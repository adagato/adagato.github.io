<b>Literature Review</b>
</p>

<p>
Instagram Reels was launched in 2020 as a competitor to TikTok and marked Instagram’s entry into the short-form video market. (Instagram, 2020) By now, Reels has been fully integrated onto Instagram’s recommended page as well as having its own tab on the app’s navigation bar which keeps it always just one click away from any location on the platform. 
As Reels, and short-form content by extension, have both grown in popularity, studies have been done on its impact on the educational field, and how the format could be introduced to structured education as a means to either supplement or replace more traditional instructional methods. Indeed, Noetel et. al (2021) discusses the effects of using video to do just this. While not explicitly short-form content, their study notes that replacing teaching with video has a positive impact on student learning roughly half of the time, while making videos as supplementary materials to existing content improves student learning in in nearly all cases, making the case that “Effectively no implementations of supplementary videos would be bad for learning”. This point hammers home how effective videos can be when combined with standard teaching methods, and as the attention spans of students fall, short-form videos as supplementary course material could prove a highly impactful method of improving student retention and interest in the subject matter.

Other studies have already implemented short-form sites like TikTok in the course material. Salomé Yélamos-Guerra et. al (2022) describes a study where students of a British history class at the University of Malaga in Spain were asked to use TikTok in a project as a means of improving their understanding of English and how it is frequently used online. They were tasked with creating a video shorter than one minute that focused on moments or chapters of British history. At the conclusion of the project, the students were surveyed on their thoughts regarding the project and the methodology behind it.  The survey responses indicated a strong appreciation for the activity as well as revealing that the methods used had a significant impact on their interest in the project. Over 94% of their respondents mentioned that the activity helped them better internalize the material and over 88% believed that they would not forget what they learned during the activity. 91% would be willing to do another activity of the same type, and over 92% believed that this setup would be useful in other courses as well. As the authors make note, these results “suggest that in this time and age the use of new technologies and social media is totally justified.” (95)

However, there is a stigma surrounding short-form content for education. It is commonly seen as a waste of time, full of misinformation, untrustworthy, or otherwise not a reliable source of information. Obeso et. al (2023) tackles this point in their paper that follows a Strategic Management class as they use Instagram as an optional supplement to the standard course material. Material posted to the class’s Instagram included news that was relevant to the field at the time using Instagram’s Stories feature, quizzes reviewing lesson material via Stories, short reviews of concepts using Reels, and solutions to certain exercises, also posted via Reels. Results of a questionnaire regarding students experiences with this type of learning were quite positive, finding that “The use of IG [Instagram] is a valuable resource for increasing BBA [Bachelor of Business Administration] students’ engagement in the learning.” (7) This further positions short form content as a method of instruction that could be used to drive student engagement in course material.

The potential of short-form content to appeal to modern students has additionally been noticed by Fiallos et. al (2021) in their study examining different educational content that could be found on TikTok, and ranked popular fields by engagement on the platform. Their studies showed that while engagement was high among many tested fields including healthcare, science, technology, education, biology, and more. The test yielded like counts of over 22.5 million for all fields, with medicine & healthcare holding the highest engagement rate of those tested with over 92.7 million likes.

In addition to being a space to support student learning, Instagram has proven itself a valuable tool to educators looking to improve and learn new strategies as well. Newton & Williams (2021) discusses “Teachergram,” a section of Instagram comprised of educators creating content for other educators regarding their classroom experiences, instruction strategies, and professional development. They found that it can be a place for self-reflection and learning even for educators as they look for new ways to instruct or seek new pathways in their careers.

In all these papers, it is clear that short-form content like the material that can be produced and found on Instagram Reels and TikTok has seen a largely successful introduction to the educational world, but there remains a gap between deciding to implement such methods into a course and actually getting to the point of implementation. That missing piece is capitalizing on some of the practices already used by educational content creators and incorporating those strategies into one’s own professional instruction. The study that follows looks at some of these practices and tracks them for their commonality between fields of study in order to inform educators on the ways that they could make their short-form content immediately understandable and familiar to their students.
