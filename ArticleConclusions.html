<b>Conclusions</b>
</p>

<p>
From the data collected, a series of recommendations can be made for instructors looking at incorporating short-form content like Reels into their course designs. 

<h3>Use Text on Screen</h3>
<p>
The vast majority of popular reels sampled used text on screen in some way. Many used them simply to caption the words spoken by the speaker. Others used them to highlight things on screen or act as the speaker in place of an audial voice. The text in the videos appeared largely as sans-serif fonts with a visible border around the edge of the text. This helps to increase contrast and readability and gives something eye-catching on the screen for viewers to look at. That it restates the spoken words only helps it convey the message of the reel to viewers.
 </p>
 
<h3>Music is Optional</h3>
<p>
Just over half of the gathered reels made use of music. Music was largely used for ambient purposes, or as filler noise in the absence of an audial speaker. As such, the choice of music does not matter significantly, though many reels chose something relatively appropriate for their content. For example, a history-focused reel selected an ambient string piece reminiscent of classical music. While not having music has led to popular reels being created, adding it to the background of a reel gives users something for their ears to pay attention to, which could keep them focused and engaged with the content.
</p>

<h3>Special Locations are Useful, but not necessary</h3>

Many tested reels made use of locations that would enhance their subject matter. Some examples of locations by reels follow:
<ul>
	<li>A reel about architecture that was filmed within the building that was being discussed</li>
	<li>A reel about paleontology that was filmed at a dig site</li>
	<li>A reel about railings in London that was filmed next to said railings</li>
	<li>A reel about filming a solar eclipse from a weather balloon using footage captured by the weather balloon</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, not all reels did this, opting instead to film indoors and talk directly to the camera. Many opted to use photos or videos instead of having a visible speaker, so the location of filming was something that the creator did not take into account. While filming from locations of interest can be useful for conveying a clearer image of the subject, opting to use simply pictures or pre-made video of the topic has also been shown to be a successful strategy.
</p>

<h3>Keep Videos Around 1 Minute in Length</h3>
<p>
The average length of all videos sampled was 52.9 seconds. This indicates that educational-focused content has a sweet spot of length around 1 minute, which offers enoguh length to convey concepts or discuss a relatively complex subject while still appealing to the kind of short attention span often found among young students.  
</p>

<br>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<h3>Limitations and Future Studies</h3>
<p>
This project was largely limited by a lack of access to advanced web crawling tools that can rapidly analyze content from Instagram Reels. This is a small sample set of popular videos from different fields of study, but it is simply not enough data to accurately track all aspects of what makes such content popular. If more resources were available, future examinations of this topic could track the time of posting as posting on peak hours of activity may yield better results for a post's popularity. It could also track the rate at which these videos become popular, as many of the videos in this sample set were posted far before the commencement of this study, and comparing the rate at which some posts receive likes, comments, and shares when compared to other posts could be interesting data to track. Another interesting point of study would be assessing the educational quality of the search results Instagram gathers using the same walkthrough method employed here. Many of the reels that the search function found had little to no relevance to the searched term, or focused far more on keeping a watcher entertained instead of educating them.
