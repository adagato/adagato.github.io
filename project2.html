<b>What Is a Minecraft Server?</b>
</p>

<p>
If you've ever wanted to play Minecraft with a group of your friends, this guide is for you! A Minecraft server lets you invite others to join a world and play together. This guide will show you how to create, launch, and host your server for free, using your home computer. You'll also learn how to port forward the server, allowing your friends to connect and play from anywhere on the globe!
<p>

<p class="TextHeader">
<b>Required Materials:</b>
</p>

<p>
Before you begin, make sure that you have the following items:
	<ul>
		<li>A computer capable of running Windows 10</li>
		<li>A router provided by your internet service provider or personally owned (this process will not work on public or university wireless networks)</li>
		<li>Minecraft Java Edition</li>
		<li>Java Runtime Environment Version 17.0.6 installed on your computer (A free download can be found <a class="link" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html">here</a>, note that other versions may work, but this guide uses version 17.0.6)</li>
	</ul>
<br>

If you have these items, you're ready to get started!</p>

<ol>
	<h2><li>Downloading the server file</h2>
		<p>To download the server file, visit <a class="link" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server">Minecraft's server download page</a> and click "Download minecraft_server.X.XX.X.jar".</p>
		
		<img class="image" src="minecraftsite.png"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Creating the server folder</h2></li>
		<p>Open File Explorer and create a new folder in your C: drive. Name it anything you'd like, but for the purpose of the guide, I'll name mine "Minecraft Server".
		</p>
		
		<img class="image" src="folder creation.gif"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Moving the server file to the new folder</h2>
		<p>Navigate to wherever your browser's downloads are stored. Then, move the downloaded server.jar file to the new server's folder.</p>
		
		<img class="image" src="file movement2.gif"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Finding the server in Command Prompt</h2>
		<p>Open Command Prompt by typing "cmd" in the windows start menu. Then, use the following commands to navigate out of the user folder and into your server's folder:
			<ol>
				<li>cd..</li>
				<li>cd..</li>
				<li>cd Minecraft Server</li>
			</ol>
		<br>
		<img class="image" src="prompt navigation.gif"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Pasting the Start Command</h2>
		<p>Next, return to the minecraft website and copy the start command shown on the website. Paste this into your command prompt window.</p>
		
		<img class="image" src="command pasting.gif"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Modifying the Start Command</h2>
		<p>While the command you pasted forms the backbone of your final start command, a few things need to be edited to make your server run well. Change both "1024" values to "2048". These values tell the computer how much Random Access Memory (RAM) to dedicate to the server while its running. Changing the value from 1024 to 2048 will give your server much more room to run smoothly on your computer without you noticing much of a performance decrease in your everyday computer usage.
		<br>
		<br>
		Secondly, change the section "minecraft_server.X.XX.X.jar" to simply read "server.jar". This is because the file you downloaded from the Minecraft website was named server.jar. The file name and the name in the start command must match in order for the server file to open.
		</p>
		<img class="image" src="command modifying.gif"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Starting the Server</h2>
		<p>Press enter to start the server. It may take a little bit to finish starting.</p>
		
		<img class="image" src="server start.gif"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Agreeing to the EULA</h2>
		<p>Notice that it failed to start the server. This is because the EULA must be agreed to. Check the server folder again and notice that a few new folders and files have populated there. Click on "eula.txt" and change "false" to "true". Save and exit the file.</p>
		
		<img class="image" src="eula agreement.gif"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Restarting the Server</h2>
		<p>Having agreed to the EULA, return to the command prompt window and re-enter the start command to restart the server.</p>
		
		<img class="image" src="server restart.gif"></img></li>
	
	<h2><li>Visiting Your Router's Website</h2>
		<P>In order to allow people outside of your local network to connect to your Minecraft server, you'll need to port forward it. You can do this by visiting your router's website. Check the back of your router for a default gateway (It might look something like 192.168.0.1), and paste it into any browser. If asked for a username and password, check your router for a sticker with that information.</p>
		
		<img class="image" src="isp website.gif"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Creating a New Port</h2>
		<p>While the specific layout of each internet provider's default gateway site may differ, each should have a tab for port forwarding. Once you find it, create a new port. The default port for a Minecraft server is 25565, so that is the port that this guide will be using. Make the port follow TCP and UDP protocols, and set both public and private ports to 25565. When asked to enter your local IP, find it in a new command prompt window by typing "ipconfig". Your local IP address will be listed on the "IPv4 Address" line.</p> 
		
		<p class="Note"><b><i>Note: local IP addresses are private information and are a risk to the security of your network and computer if made public. As such, some obfuscations have been made in the below .gif to hide local addresses on the network.</i></b></p>
		
		<img class="image" src="port creation.gif"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Finding Your Public IP Address</h2>
		<p>With the port forwarded, the next step is to find your public IP address. This address is what you will tell Minecraft to connect to, and will allow you to play on your server. To find your public IP address, type "what is my IP address" into the search engine of your choice. The number that appears will be your IP address.</p>
		
		<p class="Note"><b><i>Note: Once you have your public IP, it is STRONGLY urged that you not give it out publicly and advertise with it. Much like local IP's, giving your public IP out publicly is a security risk to your home network (albeit not as severe of a risk). Only give out your IP to people you would like to play with and trust.</i></b></p>
		
		<img class="image" src="IP address.gif"></img></li>
		
	<h2><li>Connecting To Your Server</h2>
		<p>Now that you have your public IP address, you have everything you need to connect to your server. Start Minecraft and go to the Multiplayer menu. There, click "Add Server". Type in the IP address that was found via the browser search, and click "Done". Then, find the new server in the window and click the play button. See this process in action by viewing the video below. Once you've loaded in, Congratulations! You've successfully created a minecraft server that your friends can join from anywhere, and you've learned some important coding and web skills along the way!</p>
