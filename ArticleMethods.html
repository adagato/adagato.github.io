<b>Methods</b>
</p>

<h3>Collection Methods</h3>
<p>
To find educational content matter, keyword searches were performed using Instagram’s search feature, in a similar fashion as Kerr et al. (2020) General areas of study were searched for, such as “history”, “English”, or “Science”. These were then refined as needed, sometimes needing to use a more specific area of study in order to yield criteria-appropriate posts (“Biology” or “Space” vs “Science”, for example). The search was further filtered to include only videos that made use of the Reels feature. A walkthrough method was used to collect videos that met the inclusion criteria listed below. Walkthrough was chosen as it most closely emulates the techniques and practices of a real user of the site who is browsing for educational content. It allowed for the researcher to act as a user of the site being recommended content in a similar fashion as a regular user might be and allowing the researcher to interact with the same algorithm-driven content as a standard user. (Light et. al, 2016) At a sample size of fifteen videos, data collection was deemed complete and the data was analyzed. Using the filtering methods below, content was sorted and the data sheet was constructed. The data sheet looked for the accounts that posted it, links to the videos, the topic the video covered, the descriptions used (including hashtags), whether or not there was text on each video, whether or not there was music, the general location of the video (outside, indoors, in a home, none/picture based), the length of the videos, how many likes the video had at time of collection, how many views it had at time of collection, how many comments it had at time of collection, and the date that the video was posted. Data from the chart can be found in the following section discussing the results of the study.

<h3>Inclusion Criteria</h3>
<p>
Posts were included if they were posted within the last two years (not before April 2022). The videos must have a speaker, either in the video, as a voice over, or through text on the screen, and the video must be focused on education over entertainment, by having a subject matter tied directly to the field of study that was searched for. Lastly, the videos must have had over 1 million views at the time of collection, as the study seeks to learn the strategies behind popular educational reels.

<br>
<h3>Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<p>
Posts were excluded if they did not match the inclusion criteria, were posted before April of 2022, if the reel did not match the subjeect of the search (for example, a reel for "#space" that focused on something other than what is beyond Earth's atmosphere), or if they did not make use of the Reels feature.
